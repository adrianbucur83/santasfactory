//     * Santa Claus's Factory Coding Challenge
//     * Background
//     * Santa Claus needs a software system to manage the operations of his toy factory.
//     * This system should handle toy production, inventory management, and santa's orders.
//     * Additionally, the factory uses a variety of parts to build toys, which must be tracked and categorized.
//     *
//     * Your task is to design and implement this system, ensuring it is modular, extensible, and efficient.
//
//     * Requirements
//     * 1. Toy Management
//     * Define a way to represent toys in the system.
//     * Each toy must have:
//     * A name.
//     * A category (e.g., vehicles, figurines, educational toys).
//     * A description.
//     * A production cost.
//     * Some toys may require additional, unique properties.
//
//     * 2. Factory Operations
//     * Allow the factory <<<<< to:
//     * Produce <<< toys and add <<< them to an inventory <<<<<.
//     * Retrieve <<<< toys by their category.
//     * Calculate <<< the total production cost <<< of all toys in the inventory.
//     * Take a toy order <<<< from SantaClaus
//
//     * 3. Toy Parts
//     * Toys are built from parts. Each part has:
//     * A part name.
//     * A category indicating the type of toy it is used to build.
//     * A toy is created only if we can gather all the parts for it
//     * Each part costs 1 Euro
//
//     * 4. Order Management
//     Create a way to represent orders, tracking:
//     * Customer name (Santa)
//     * The list of toys included in the order with quantities
//     * The total max cost of the order (based on the production cost of toys).
//
//     * 5. Design Principles
//     * Design the system effectively.
//     * Use enums to define categories for toys and parts.
//     * Select appropriate data structures to manage inventory, parts, and orders.
//
//     * 6. Testing
//     * Write tests to validate:
//     * The creation of toys and parts.
//     * The factory's ability to manage inventory and calculate total costs.
//     * Order functionality, including the correct calculation of total costs.
//
//     * Key Goals
//     * Extensibility: The system should easily accommodate new toy types, categories, or parts.
//     * Efficiency: Use suitable data structures for scalability and fast lookups.
//     * Readability: Write clean, maintainable code that adheres to object-oriented principles.
//     *
